We firmly believe in the value and importance of an environment where all AWS community members feel welcome and safe. This Code of Conduct explains what type of behavior we expect from AWS community members interacting at live events, virtual events, and across AWS blogs, online forums, and social media. The purpose of our AWS events, both live and virtual, and community engagement across social media forums is to foster technical and professional education and encourage community discussion. The terms of this Code of Conduct are non-negotiable. We will not tolerate behavior that runs counter to this Code of Conduct.
